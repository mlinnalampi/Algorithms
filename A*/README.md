# A*

During "Artificial Intelligence" -course we were required to implement A* algorithm, given the body of code. Everything commited in the first commit was given, anything after that was done by me. So my task was just to implement the actual algorithmic logic, while everything else was handled for us.

P.S. I'm Commiting this only after the deadline and skipping the course code to reduce risk of foul use of this code during current & future iterations of the course.
